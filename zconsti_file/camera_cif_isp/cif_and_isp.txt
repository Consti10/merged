// somehow camera_enginge_rkisp needs to optain the camera frames (after) cif.

I think this is done in 
external/camera_engine_rkaiq/hwi/isp20/Isp20PollThread.cpp
Isp20PollThread::trigger_readback()

trigger_readback() is called in multiple places:
set_hdr_frame_readback_infos(int frame_id, int times)
sync_tx_buf() 3x

sync_tx_buf() is called from handle_tx_buf()
which in turn is called from mipi_poll_buffer_loop()
which in turn is called from MipiPollThread::loop()
